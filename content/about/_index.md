Hi, I am Alexandre Bléron. I can write code and do research, with a specialization in computer graphics.
I studied at Université Grenoble Alpes, France, where I obtained a PhD in 2018. 

My research interests revolve mostly around computer graphics, and more specifically non-photorealistic -- or _expressive_ -- rendering:
i.e. finding new ways to render 3D scenes that give more freedom to artists (artist direction), 
and allow visual styles that deviate significantly from photorealism or the traditional look of computer graphics.
Among those, I am particularly interested in reproducing appearances found in _digital painting_.

You can find my CV [here](/cv.pdf). 
I also have a blog (right here) which might contain posts at some point.

## Research

During my PhD, I focused on two aspects of stylized rendering: the design of stylized _shading models_, 
and the rendering of brush strokes with image filtering techniques.

## Projects

Some old free-time programming projects (mostly unfinished) that I have been working on in the past, and more recent stuff,
which can be found on my [github page](https://github.com/ennis).
I mostly favor the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to build stuff these days. 

* [path-tracer](https://github.com/ennis/path-tracer): a small path tracer in C++, inspired by smallpt. 
* [xxgui](https://github.com/ennis/xxgui): a work-in-progress immediate-mode GUI library for Rust.
